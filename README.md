Ship Tracking System with AIS Messages
this is the backend for the dristhi app 

Project Overview
The Ship Tracking System with AIS Messages is a powerful and efficient solution for monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing the movements of vessels in real-time. It leverages the AIS technology, which allows ships to broadcast key information such as their position, speed, course, and identification details. This system captures, processes, and interprets AIS messages to offer comprehensive ship tracking capabilities.

Key Features
1. Real-time Ship Tracking
Receive AIS messages from vessels to track their current positions in real-time.
Visualize ship locations on an interactive map, providing a clear view of vessel movements.
2. Historical Data Analysis
Store and archive AIS messages for historical analysis and reporting.
Retrieve historical data to gain insights into past vessel activities, routes, and behaviors.
3. Vessel Information
Collect and maintain detailed information about vessels, including their names, types, dimensions, and more.
Enable users to access vessel-specific data for better understanding and identification.
4. Notifications and Alerts
Set up custom alerts and notifications based on predefined criteria, such as vessel proximity or deviation from a designated route.
5. Interactive User Interface
Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface for users to interact with ship tracking data effortlessly.
Provide features for data filtering, search, and customized views.
6. Geographic Fencing
Implement geofencing capabilities to define virtual geographic boundaries for monitoring.
Trigger alerts and actions when vessels enter or exit specified regions.
7. Integration Options
Support integration with external AIS data sources and sensors.
Enable data sharing with other maritime systems and platforms.
Benefits
Enhance maritime security: Identify and respond to unusual ship behavior or unauthorized vessel entries.
Improve vessel traffic management: Optimize routes and avoid congestion in busy waterways.
Enhance search and rescue operations: Quickly locate and assist vessels in distress.
Streamline port operations: Monitor vessel arrivals and departures for efficient harbor management.
Ensure compliance: Monitor vessel activities to ensure adherence to maritime regulations.
The Ship Tracking System with AIS Messages is a versatile and indispensable tool for maritime authorities, port operators, shipping companies, and anyone involved in vessel monitoring and management.
